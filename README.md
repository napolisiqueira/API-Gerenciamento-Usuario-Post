# Flask API

This is a study project using Flask API â€” my first API as well.  
I'm following the Python Back-End course by DIO (Digital Innovation One).

You can check the versions of the dependencies in `uv.lock` and `uv.toml`.

I'm currently using Flask in general, with the following extensions:
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** as the ORM to manage the database.
- **Flask-Migrate** to handle database versioning.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended** for authentication and authorization in the API.
